# A website for some tech demos

we're using Python's Flask webserver for the back-end:

http://flask.pocoo.org/

to run this, first make sure that pip3 is installed on your system (pip3 is the python3 equivalent of pip). this is usually not a problem on macOS since pip3 is installed by default there. Run `which pip3` to make sure that its installed.

i've written a simple makefile to help install flask and run the webapp

to setup: 

    make setup

to run:

    make run

to clean up:

    make clean
